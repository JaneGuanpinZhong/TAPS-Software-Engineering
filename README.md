In our university, The computer science department is often busy dealing with assigning graduate TAs at the beginning of
the semester. The course Software Engineering I is aiming to create a software that can improve the situation. 

Consequently, the TA Processing System (TAPS) is designed to help solve this problem. Specifically,
the faculty and TAs can use it to satisfy their requests, and administrators can use it to deal with the data
more conveniently. In general this software is able to increase the efficiency when dealing with the TA
issues.

This folder includes eight assignments which cover different stages of analysis and design. See specific documents 
for more information.
